# 📝 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Purpose
This product is a web application designed for marketing experts to generate and manage comprehensive marketing campaigns using AI Agents powered by the Microsoft Agent Framework. The system streamlines the creation of campaign artifacts by leveraging specialized agents that generate copy, short social media copy, and visual posters, ensuring cohesive strategy with an auditing layer for compliance.

## 2. Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - Development of a web app with both frontend and backend components.
  - Integration of AI Agents for campaign artifact generation (copy, short copy, and visuals).
  - Implementation of a dedicated audit agent to review and ensure compliance of generated content.
  - Interactive user interface providing real-time feedback and display of artifacts from various agents.

- **Out of Scope:**
  - Manual content creation without AI assistance.
  - Offline campaign management capabilities.
  - Integration with third-party marketing platforms beyond initial artifact generation.

## 3. Goals & Success Criteria
- **Business/User Goals:**
  - Empower marketing experts to quickly generate and iterate on campaign materials.
  - Enhance campaign effectiveness through AI-driven creative inputs and compliance checks.
  - Streamline the workflow between different creative teams (copywriter, media manager, designer).

- **Success Criteria:**
  - Reduction in time required for campaign creation.
  - High quality, compliant marketing artifacts as reviewed by the audit agent.
  - Positive user feedback and increased campaign performance metrics.

## 4. High-Level Requirements
- [REQ-1] The system shall integrate multiple AI Agents (for copy, short copy, and visuals) to generate campaign artifacts.
- [REQ-2] The system shall include a dedicated auditing agent that reviews and ensures the compliance of all generated content.
- [REQ-3] The web application shall provide an interactive UI to display the real-time outputs from each agent along with an integrated review dashboard.

## 5. User Stories
```gherkin
As a marketing expert, I want to generate a complete marketing campaign, so that I can launch effective and compliant campaigns quickly.

As a marketing expert, I want to view separate sections for copy, social media posts, and poster visuals, so that I can easily assess and edit each campaign artifact.

As a marketing expert, I want an AI auditor to validate campaign artifacts, so that I can ensure all outputs meet compliance and quality standards.
```

## 6. Assumptions & Constraints
- **Assumptions:**
  - The AI Agents are effectively integrated via the Microsoft Agent Framework.
  - Agents will operate collaboratively to ensure consistency across campaign materials.

- **Constraints:**
  - Performance overhead must be minimized despite multiple agent integrations.
  - Strict compliance and auditing procedures must be maintained to meet marketing standards and regulations.

## 7. API Requirements

The system must expose the following minimal API endpoints:

### Campaign Creation
- **Endpoint**: Create new campaign
  - **Input**: Campaign brief (theme, target audience, product details)
  - **Output**: Campaign ID and initial status
  - **Error handling**: Return clear error messages for invalid inputs

### Campaign Generation
- **Endpoint**: Generate campaign artifacts
  - **Input**: Campaign ID
  - **Output**: Generated artifacts (copy, short copy, poster)
  - **Error handling**: Return clear error messages if generation fails

### Campaign Retrieval
- **Endpoint**: Get campaign details
  - **Input**: Campaign ID
  - **Output**: Campaign brief and all generated artifacts
  - **Error handling**: Return 404 if campaign not found

**Note**: Initial implementation should use simple REST endpoints. Real-time updates can be added later if needed.

## 8. User Interface Requirements

The web application must provide:

### Campaign Creation Screen
- Form to input campaign brief including:
  - Campaign theme/topic
  - Target audience description
  - Product/service details
- Submit button to initiate campaign generation
- Clear error messages for validation failures

### Campaign Display Screen
- Three distinct sections showing:
  1. **Copy Section**: Full marketing copy generated by copy agent
  2. **Social Media Section**: Short-form social posts
  3. **Visual Section**: Poster/visual content description or metadata
- Loading indicators during artifact generation
- Error messages if generation fails
- Retry button for failed generations

### Audit Results Display
- Clear indication of compliance status (passed/failed)
- Feedback from audit agent displayed alongside artifacts
- Option to regenerate if audit fails

**Note**: Start with simple page-based navigation. Single-page application patterns can be added later if needed.

## 9. Agent Workflow Requirements

The system must orchestrate the following agent workflow:

### Content Generation Phase
- Execute three agents to generate campaign artifacts:
  1. **Copy Agent**: Generates full marketing copy
  2. **Short Copy Agent**: Generates social media posts
  3. **Poster Agent**: Generates visual poster concepts/descriptions
- All agents receive the same campaign brief as input
- Agents should complete within reasonable time (target: under 30 seconds each)

### Audit Phase
- **Audit Agent** reviews all generated artifacts
- Validates compliance with marketing standards
- Returns approval status and feedback
- If audit fails, user can retry generation with feedback

### Workflow Behavior
- User initiates campaign creation
- System executes content generation agents
- System executes audit agent on generated content
- System returns results to user interface

**Note**: Start with sequential execution (one agent after another). Parallel execution and advanced retry logic can be added later if performance requires it.

## 10. Data Requirements

The system must handle the following data during operation:

### Campaign Brief Data
- Campaign theme/topic (text)
- Target audience description (text)
- Product/service details (text)

### Generated Artifact Data
- Marketing copy (text)
- Social media posts (text, multiple items)
- Poster visual descriptions (text)

### Audit Results Data
- Compliance status (pass/fail)
- Audit feedback/comments (text)

**Note**: Initial implementation can store data in-memory during user session. Persistent database storage can be added later if campaigns need to be saved long-term.

## 11. Error Handling Requirements

The system must handle common error scenarios:

### User Input Errors
- Validate campaign brief inputs (required fields)
- Display clear error messages for missing or invalid data
- Prevent submission with incomplete forms

### Agent Execution Errors
- Handle agent timeout or failure gracefully
- Display error message to user indicating which agent failed
- Provide retry option for failed operations

### System Errors
- Display user-friendly error messages (avoid technical jargon)
- Log errors for debugging purposes
- Maintain system stability when individual agents fail

**Note**: Start with basic try/catch error handling and simple error messages. Advanced resilience patterns can be added later if needed.
